# Fusion-Connector
Send &amp; receive data over a Yaesu System Fusion network using 3rd party devices.

# Introduction
Yaesu System Fusion is an amateur radio protocol which uses C4FM modulation to facilitate the transmission & reception of digitally encoded voice, text messages, and images.  While the system has significant capability, Yaesu's development model focuses on leveraging features of the Fusion system primarily using Yaesu-manufactured hardware.

Fusion-Connector enables the transmission of text messages and images over System Fusion using 3rd party hardware.
